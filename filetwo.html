  Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the
  way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means
  of  marking  up  the  structure  of  a  document  not  as  a  way  of  determining  its  presentation.
  Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear
  in a printed document.
  This

  is
  Cool.
